# HTML Builder

This is a small utility built primarily to reduce the tedium of editing my portfolio website.

Currently it's hardcoded to the template design of my own website, but I may improve it in future to allow for definition of custom template mappings.

# Feature Set
- Configurable input and output locations
- Insertion of html files into a template

# Future Considerations
- Configurable mappings for arbitrary folders, templates, and insertion points
- Retrieval and deployment of referenced media
- Site deployment through FTP
- Data parsing (Potentially using a configurable ruleset?)
